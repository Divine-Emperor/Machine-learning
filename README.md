# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Algorithms** repository! This folder contains a collection of various machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals or an experienced practitioner seeking to refine your skills, this repository has something for everyone.


## Introduction

Machine learning is a powerful tool that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of various machine learning algorithms, along with explanations and examples to help you understand how they work.

## Algorithms Included

This repository includes implementations of the following machine learning algorithms:

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Linear Regression
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forests
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - K-Means Clustering
   - Hierarchical Clustering
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
3. **Natural Language Processing**
   - NlP
   - tokeization
   - lemitization
   - bag of words
  
## Usage

Each algorithm folder contains a Jupyter Notebook or Python script with the following structure:

- **Description**: A brief overview of the algorithm and its applications.
- **Implementation**: The code for the algorithm, including necessary imports and functions.
- **Example**: A practical example demonstrating how to use the algorithm with sample data.

To run the examples, you can use Jupyter Notebook or execute the Python scripts directly.
